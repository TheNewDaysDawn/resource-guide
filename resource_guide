  <p><em>Getting and Finding Answers</em></p>

  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> &nbsp;This is a Q&amp;A site
  for programmers. &nbsp;You can actually post a code snippet here and say "Why doesn't
  this work?" But be sure to search first to make sure your question hasn't been
  answered! You'll get snark if you don't.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em>Meetups</em></p>

  <p>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you find a local group devoted to the
  programming language you choose to start learning in. &nbsp;<em>If you are using books
  or online tutorials, at some point you will get stuck. &nbsp;If you don't have anyone
  to help you, you will stay stuck.</em> You can check <a href=
  "http://meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> for these. &nbsp;I was helped immensely by the
  members of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/">BostonPHP</a> Meetup
  group.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span><strong>Setting up a development environment on your
  computer&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

  <p>You will want to create a "development environment" on your computer. &nbsp;This
  replicates the web server you'll eventually use to host your programs, and typically
  includes web server software, a database, and files and packages required by the
  programming language you intend to use. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>There are several (free!) bundles for popular operating systems:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> (MacOS, Apache, MySQL,
  PHP)&nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">WAMP</a> (Windows, Apache, MySQL,
  PHP)&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When you download and install these, you have a small, live webserver on your laptop
  that you can load your programs onto and test. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>For other programming languages, you may have to download and install things to make
  it work:</p>

  <p><em>Ruby</em><br />
  <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-install-ruby-on-a-mac/">Setting
  Up Ruby on Mac OSX&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(Expert level; looking for beginners' guides
  suggestions)&nbsp;<br />
  <a href=
  "http://allaboutruby.wordpress.com/2006/01/09/installing-rails-on-windows-step-by-step-tutorial/">
  Setting up Ruby on Windows</a></p>

  <p><em>Python</em><br />

  Mac OSX</a><br />

  Python on Windows</a>&nbsp;(Expert level; looking for beginners' guides
  suggestions)&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span><strong>Text Editors</strong></span></p>

  <p>You'll need something to actually write your programs in. &nbsp;Programmers have
  extraordinarily strong opinions about these. &nbsp;Two popular editors, vi and EMACS,
  both run in the command line in Unix. &nbsp;I've restricted this list to graphical text
  editors. &nbsp;(Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/greglinch">Greg Linch</a> and
  <a href="http://twitter.com/macdiva">Chrys Wu</a> for additional suggestions of free,
  graphical text editors).&nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>&nbsp;This is what I
  use. &nbsp;Not free, but free trial.&nbsp;<br />
  <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> MacOS editor. &nbsp;People I know have
  said good things about it. Not free, but free trial.&nbsp;<br />
  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> is the free
  "little sister" of BBEdit.<br />
  <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gEdit</a> is a simple, lightweight text
  editor. &nbsp;Free and open source.&nbsp;<br />
  <a href="http://www.amyeditor.com/">AmyEditor</a> is an online, collaborative text
  editor (that is, you can edit code in the browser while another coder looks on from
  over the web). &nbsp;Free.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span><strong>Version Control</strong></span></p>

  <p>A version control system stores your code safely and allows you to "roll back" your
  changes to a point in time before you screwed it up. &nbsp;You will want it.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is the version control system I use. &nbsp;Git
  is relatively new. &nbsp;SVN is probably the version control system in widest use
  today, and CVS is the old warhorse of version control. &nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="http://mac.github.com/">Github for Mac</a> -- a graphical client that lets
  me see my "repositories" and check in code to Github, the popular online code-sharing
  site.&nbsp;<br />
  <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>&nbsp;is a hosted version of Git (read: you don't
  have to download and install Git). &nbsp;In addition to doing all the things you want a
  version control system to do, it stores your stuff in the cloud, AND you can browse and
  share code. &nbsp;Many news organizations, including the <a href=
  "https://github.com/NYTimes">New York Times</a>, <a href=
  "https://github.com/newsapps">The Chicago Tribune</a>, and <a href=
  "https://github.com/propublica">ProPublica</a> have Github pages where you can view --
  and download! -- their code. &nbsp;(<a href="http://github.com/lisawilliams">Here's
  where you can find my code on Github.</a> &nbsp;Friend me when you get there.)</p>

  <p><span><strong>Bug Tracking</strong></span></p>

  <p>One happy day you'll move your baby code onto the web and launch something...and
  then you'll have to track bugs and new feature requests! &nbsp;To keep that from
  devolving into a pile of inscrutable email, use a bug tracker. &nbsp;It will let other
  members of your team make notes about bugs, or about new feature requests. &nbsp;You'll
  end up with a neat, cleanly ordered list of requests which you can rank by priority.
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="http://16bugs.com/">16Bugs</a> -- This is what I use. &nbsp;It's VERY
  simple, but I like that, and it also integrates with Basecamp. &nbsp;Free for single
  projects.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span><strong>Programming resources for women</strong></span></p>

  <p><a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a><br />
  <a href="http://pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>&nbsp;and on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=
  "http://twitter.com/pyladies">@pyladies</a>&nbsp;<br />
  <a href="http://webstartwomen.com/">Web Start Women&nbsp;</a></p>

  <p><span><strong>Programming resources for kids</strong></span></p>

  <p><a href="http://hackety-hack.net">Hackety Hack</a> -- teaches kids to program in
  Ruby. Good for former children, too.&nbsp;<br />
  <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> -- a programming language and environment
  developed for kids; designed to encourage kids to create games and animations.
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p><span><strong>Programming Blogs</strong></span></p>

  <p>(I've only listed blogs here I actually personally read. &nbsp;Please do feel free
  to suggest more!)</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror<br /></a><a href=
  "http://scripting.com">Scripting.com</a> &nbsp;(Not always about programming, but
  always worth reading).&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span><strong>Things I've Written about Learning to Program</strong></span></p>

  <p>This page is a list of ingredients -- but a list of ingredients isn't a recipe.
  &nbsp;If you're looking for pointers on where to begin, read <a href=
  "http://lifeandcode.tumblr.com/post/12037465634/learning-to-program-for-the-web-starting-from-scratch">
  Learning to Code for the Web: Starting from Scratch</a>. &nbsp;If you're a journalist

  learn, read&nbsp;<a href=

  <p>Learning to code takes effort, and everybody has to answer the all-important "why
  bother?" question for themselves. &nbsp;Here's mine:&nbsp;<a href=
